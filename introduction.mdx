## About Phylex

Welcome to the official Phylex Platforms hosting documentation! Here, we've gathered all the information to help you explore and manage our services.

### Who We Are
We are the Phylex hosting team, dedicated to providing quality hosting services. Phylex started in 2022 as a game hosting provider. Over the years, we’ve faced both successes and challenges. Initially known as "PhylexNodes," we rebranded to "Phylex" in 2024 as we expanded our offerings. Now, as an official entity of PHYLEX PLATFORMS LTD (registered as company 15426885), we provide a range of hosting solutions—from game hosting to virtual servers.
